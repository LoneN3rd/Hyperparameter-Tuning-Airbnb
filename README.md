# Hyperparameter Tuning Project
## Background
Airbnb is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California, United States. Airbnb offers arrangements for lodging, primarily
homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking.

## Problem Statement
As a Data Scientist working for Airbnb, you have been tasked to create a model that predicts Airbnb rental prices for the city of Amsterdam. The popularity of Airbnbs in Amsterdam has grown over the past years and you are required to build a solution that would make optimal predictions.

## Dataset Information
The data provided is an open-source dataset from Airbnb with a cut-off date of 16th April 2020. This is a summary dataset, which means a lot of non-essential
columns have been trimmed to make the data easy to use and understand.
